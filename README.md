## Final Paper

## Download Files
Script to download data.

## Train_Val_Test_Split
Metadata and train, validation, test split.

## Models
Model1: Pretrained moel from Liu et al. (images are downsampled)

-contains Python scripts to run models, directory ("CNN_design_for_AD-master") adapted from [Liu et al.](https://github.com/NYUMedML/CNN_design_for_AD) containing necessary files to build model, and notebook to evaluate models ("Pretrained Model Analysis and Plots.ipynb"). To run pretrained model, please download the [pretrained weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zU21Kin9kXg_qmj7w_u5dGOjXf1D5fa7/view) to "CNN_design_for_AD-master/saved_model". For model 1, a sample .txt file containing structure, weights, loss, and accuracies are available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=142D-6zWFjPcDWpyr2_y9q3vWIwtEo_BI).
